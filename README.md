pip install image-optimization
```

Make sure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed on your machine.

## Usage

After installation, you can start using the toolkit in your Python scripts. Here’s a simple example to get you started:

```python
from image_optimization import ImageOptimizer

optimizer = ImageOptimizer(provider='aws')
optimized_image = optimizer.optimize('path/to/image.jpg')
```

For more detailed usage instructions, please refer to the documentation.

## Provider Support

This toolkit supports multiple providers:

- **AWS CloudFront/S3**: Seamless integration with your AWS account.
- **Cloudinary CDN**: Easy setup and configuration for using Cloudinary.

You can specify your preferred provider during initialization or let the toolkit automatically detect it.

## Batch Processing

The toolkit allows you to process images in bulk. You can provide a CSV file with image paths, and the toolkit will handle the rest. Here’s how to do it:

1. Create a CSV file with the following format:

```
image_path
path/to/image1.jpg
path/to/image2.jpg
```

2. Use the batch processing function:

```python
optimizer.batch_process('path/to/images.csv')
```

This feature saves time and ensures consistency across your image optimization tasks.

## AI-Generated Alt Text

Accessibility is crucial. This toolkit includes an AI-generated alt text feature. When you optimize an image, the toolkit will automatically generate descriptive alt text based on the image content. This helps improve your site's SEO and makes it more accessible to users with visual impairments.

## Smart Format Selection

The toolkit intelligently selects the best image format for each file. It considers factors like image type, size, and intended use. This ensures that your images load quickly without sacrificing quality.

## Unified API

The unified API simplifies the integration process. Regardless of which provider you choose, the API remains consistent. This makes it easy to switch providers or use multiple providers without changing your code.

## Auto-Provider Detection

The auto-provider detection feature identifies the best provider based on your configuration and available resources. This allows for a seamless experience, ensuring you get the best performance without manual intervention.
